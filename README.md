# Barcelona Walking Tours

## Overview 

For my second milestone project, I decided to create a website to encourage sustainable tourism and an environmentally friendly way to explore a new city, 
by promoting walking tours and sustainable living while visiting. I have decided to focus on one city that has a large influx of tourists, and one of touists often 
been myself, Barcelona in Spain. 

The aims of sustainable tourism is to increase the benefits and to reduce the negative impacts caused by tourism for destinations. This can be achieved by: 
- Providing authentic tourist experiences that celebrate and conserve heritage and culture. 
- Creating socio-economic benefits for communities through employment and income earning opportunities. 
 
The website is split into four sections. The first being the ‘home’ section which acts as a menu summarising each section and allows the user to navigate to the three other sections. 
These remaining sections are titled Walking Tours, Plan Your Trip and Check The Weather. 

## Walking Tours

The walking tour have been inspired by Barcelona’s famous architecture. By exploring the city on tour and being educated by a guide provides an authentic tourist experience, aim one of sustainable tourism, while remaining eco-friendly and avoiding the use of public transportation. 

A user can click on a tour, read the information about that specific tour and see the different landmarks included in the tour displayed on the Google Map. The can also send a booking enquiry for a specific tour. 

## Plan Your Trip 

This section of the website also utilizes the same Google Map, however, the options change from the tour names to different eco-friendly amenities. This allows a user to search for eco-friendly accommodation, cafes, restaurants and shops, and see where they are located in the city by the markers on the Google map. 
Referring to the second aim of sustainable tourism, this promotes local businesses, and create opportunities for the growth of environmentally friendly establishments. 

## Check The Weather

Check The Weather allows the user to input any city name and search for the current weather. The purpose for this section is to encourage the user to plan their attire for the day based on the weather i.e. take an umbrella or pack an anorak. It provides the playful example that the world throws away enough umbrellas to rebuild the eiffel tower 25 times. 
However, this carries the serious message of the impact of purchasing cheap umbrellas and single use plastic cagoule, which are designed to end up in the bin. 

## The Website's Future Potential

Presently, the website focuses on one city that experience a high level of tourism. However, with some further research, it has the potential to grow and provide walking tours and information for  
multiple cities uses the Google Map and weather finder. 

# UX

The overall aim for this single page website is to look clean, straightforward and uncomplicated. This has been achieved by using a simple colour scheme throughout the site, creating a lot of space between the sections with padding and utilizing Jquery show/hide to avoid over cluttering the page and providing an interactive alternative.

The user should have the feeling that they are able to ‘flow’ through the different sections of the site. The use of smooth scrolling by from the navbar or using the ‘explore’ buttons provides this affect. As the website requires the use of two google maps, the sections toggle between show/hide so that the same map is used reducing loading time for the site. This also gives the visual impression of the sections flowing into each other with the smooth transition.

The UX design will be further explained in the wireframes below. NB: there are some differences between the wireframes and the finished design.

## Wireframes

![Wireframe 1](https://i.ibb.co/VQ3TKZ6/Header-Desktop.png =100x100)
![Wireframe 2](https://i.ibb.co/j46FnBG/Header-mobile.png =100x100)

The site using a static navbar on both mobile and desktop which allows the user to move around the different sections of the website easily. The navbar shirnks 
as the user moves down the page allowing the logo to be more noticable when the site has first loaded. 

There is an eye-catching masthead showing a birds-eye view of Barcelona and a button allowing the user to "Explore" further. 

![Wireframe 3](https://i.ibb.co/BGY53B1/Home-Desktop.png =100x100)
![Wireframe 4](https://i.ibb.co/bdcKL7H/Home-Mobile.png =100x100)

This "Explore" button moves the site to the home section. This section is acts as a clean introduction to the site and another point of navigation that the user 
can easily return to. 

![Wireframe 5](https://i.ibb.co/tCQmqJf/Tours-Desktop.png =100x100)
![Wireframe 6](https://i.ibb.co/SVHfPGJ/Tours-Mobile.png =100x100)

When a user clicks one of the tours, text descibing the tour will appear below the buttons and google markers will appear on the map showing the landmarks that
specific tour will pass. The text is hidden to avoid having a high amount of text on the page and makes it clear which information applies to which tour. The colour
of the buttons also matches the google map icons providing a clear correllation between the tour and it's landmarks. This provides an interactive and visualling 
pleasing way to present the informationt to the user.

![Wireframe 7](https://i.ibb.co/RhgqkWH/Sustainable-Tourism-Desktop.png =100x100)
![Wireframe 8](https://i.ibb.co/4snXsX8/Sustainable-Tourism-Mobile.png =100x100)

Both the walking tours and plan your trip sections are similar with the differences being the text and buttons. The same Google Map is used to avoid the website
loading to many features and slowing down. 

![Wireframe 9](https://i.ibb.co/4V9sYCp/Booking-Enquiry-Modal.png =100x100)

The booking enquiry modal for desktop is straightforward and easy to use. This will be full screen on mobile with the ability to close the modal.

![Wireframe 10](https://i.ibb.co/VpsvGCF/Check-The-Weather-desktop.png =100x100)
![Wireframe 11](https://i.ibb.co/Fb8cKkR/Check-The-Weather-mobile.png =100x100)

The Check The Weather section is simple and clear. There is a placeholder image and text which will change to the details of the valid city that the user has inputted.
